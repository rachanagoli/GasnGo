-Install NodeJS
-Install Angular (npm install -g @angular/cli)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


## Intended use of the system:
A rental service is a service in which customers arrive to request the hire of a rental unit. It is more convenient than carrying the cost of owning and maintaining the unit. A car rental or car hire agency is a company that rents automobiles for a short period of time for a fee whether in a few hours or a few days or week. It is an extended form of a rental shop, often organized with numerous local branches (which allow a user to return a vehicle to a different location), and primarily located near airports or busy city areas and often complemented by a website allowing online reservations.

Car rental agencies primarily serve people who have a car that is temporarily out of reach or out of service, for example travelers who are out of town or owners of damaged or destroyed vehicles who are awaiting repair or insurance compensation. Because of the variety of sizes of their vehicles, car rental agencies may also serve the self- moving industry needs, by renting RVs or trucks, and in certain markets other types of vehicles such as motorbikes may also be offered.

**Overall functionality:**
A web application where users can rent a car by uploading their driver’s license when they need a car. In the application we make the user login into the system with a valid driver’s license and be able to book a vehicle according to his/her need. The login’s will be of two types: i.e., the admin and the user. The admin login will enable the admin to input the cars available for the users who can take them as rent if required. The user login will help the user to login to the system and gives the user the choice to choose a car to rent from the cars that were made available by the admin. Admin can manage the car rentals, booking IDs and approve the reservation and monitor bookings whereas, the users will not have any access to the system related information other than the option to check the availability of the vehicles that can be rented. The system is a user-friendly interface which allows users to book and track the cars. If a vehicle is not available, the system sends a notification to the user whenever the vehicle is available. The system provides security to the users using their login functionality.


**Main components of the system:**
Creating a web site requires multiple steps which includes the following
1. Creating a UI(User interface)
2. Scripting(Both at server end and client end)
3. Creating a backend or the database

Technologies that are mostly used to develop a User Interface are HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, Angular material. There are two scripting methodologies. Server-side scripting (This scripting is done at the server end), Client-side scripting: This scripting is done at the client end or the browser. The database contains the information about the users and the admin. To interact with the browser, HTML, CSS is used. A database is an organized collection of data. It is the collection of schemas, tables, queries, reports, views, and other objects. The data are typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information.
